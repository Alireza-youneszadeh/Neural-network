this file consists of neural network algorithm implemented on handwritten digit recognition .in this code the neural network packages such as tensorflow,keras and sklearn have been used
the dataset consists of two csv files which are train and test dataset ,
the dataset is 28*28 grey_scale image which the first column is the output consists of 10 classes (digits from 0 to 9),
the neural network with 3 layers has been considered.
finally the accuracy has been defined on test dataset.
the dataset address is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eEKzfmEu6WKdRlohBQiqi3PhW_uIVJVP/view?usp=sharing
